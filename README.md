# -CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. It utilizes classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and XGBoost to identify potentially fraudulent transactions, with the aim of minimizing financial losses for companies while ensuring legitimate transactions are not falsely flagged.

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) used in this project is a publicly available Kaggle dataset, which contains anonymized credit card transactions. The features include anonymized attributes (V1-V28), transaction amount, and a binary fraud label.
